# Known Issues

As of end of Labs 35:

- Due to change of backend schema, many model functions still do not work. They still have to be re-written and updated. 



As of May 28, last day of Labs34 cohort:

- Service Entries authorization is not yet implemented - need to add middleware to restrict create/edit/delete of service_entries to authorized users (Administrator, Program Manager, Service Provider). You can utilize the test user with "unassigned" role to test against.
