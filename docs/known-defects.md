# Known Issues

As of May 28, last day of Labs34 cohort:

- Service Entries authorization is not yet implemented - need to add middleware to restrict create/edit/delete of service_entries to authorized users (Administrator, Program Manager, Service Provider). You can utilize the test user with "unassigned" role to test against.
